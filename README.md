# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The project template was provided by Lighthouse Labs. I was responsible for implementing front-end functionality including:
  - Tweet submission (using AJAX requests and jQuery)
  - Overall styling of the page
  - The responsive design (for screens shorter than 1024 pixels)
  - The HTML for the navbar, header and main container

Back-end functionality, such as the database setup and external files, was provided by Lighthouse Labs.
